An NixOS cluster deployment tool.

== Advantages over existing configuration systems (NixOps/Morph)

- Modules can configure multiple hosts at once (I.e for wireguard/kubernetes installation)
- Secrets can be securely stored in Git (No one except target hosts can decrypt them), automatically regenerated, reencrypted, etc.
- Automatic rollback on deployment failure, which will work, as long as system is passing initrd stage (So still be carefull with root filesystem mount)
